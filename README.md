# COVID‑19 Data Analysis & Forecasting

**Explore, analyze, and predict COVID‑19 trends using real-world data and time‑series modeling.**

---

## 📁 Project Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of global COVID‑19 infection and death trends, including:

- Detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Data cleaning, visualization, and statistical summary.
- **Predictive Modeling** using time-series forecasting techniques like ARIMA and Prophet.
- **Interactive Visualizations** that reveal growth patterns and future trends.
- **Model Evaluation** based on metrics such as MAPE, RMSE, MAE, and R².

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** with libraries like `pandas`, `NumPy`, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data wrangling and visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**, **Statsmodels**, and **Prophet** for predictive modeling.
- **Jupyter Notebook** as the primary environment for analysis and documentation.
- Optional: **Streamlit** or **Dash** (if building an interactive dashboard for visualization).

🧪 Data Sources
Data used in this project is gathered from public sources such as Johns Hopkins University or Our World in Data, covering confirmed cases, recoveries, and fatalities from January 2020 to the most recent available.

📈 Forecasting & Evaluation
Compared ARIMA and Facebook Prophet models for short‑term predictions.

Evaluated each model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

Summarized results in comparative graphs and tables.

🔍 Key Insights
Visualization of daily cases, recovery rates, and trends across countries or regions.

Forecast output that estimates future case numbers, helping to evaluate potential future trajectories.

Observations on model strengths, limitations, and potential areas for fine-tuning.

🧭 Use Cases & Extensions
This project forms a base that can be extended to:

Interactive dashboards for real-time tracking (Streamlit, Dash).

Additional models (e.g. LSTM, XGBoost, Prophet with exogenous variables, hybrid methods).

Regional forecasts at country or state level.

Integration with real-time data APIs for automated model updates.
